# freeplaneMM2Markdown
Custom mm to markdown export based on the original one. This one convert node to title only if it as child or htmlcontent.

I've made this export from my own needs when using freeplane to create my literary notes for Obsidian.

## How to install

1. Start freeplane
2. Go to "Outils > Ouvrir le dossier utilisateur"
3. Put `mm2obsidian.xsl` file into the `xslt` directory.
4. Restart freeplane

## How to use

Open a map and go to "Fichier > Exporter la carte..." then choose "Obsidian (.md, .markdown)"

## Compatibility
Tested with Freeplane 1.9.14 but should work with all releases.
